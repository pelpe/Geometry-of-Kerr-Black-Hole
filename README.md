# Geometry-of-Kerr-Black-Hole
Mathematica 12.2.0 is used to calculate Christoffel symbols, Riemann tensor, Ricci scalar, and Kretschmann scalar for the Kerr metric in rational polynomial coordinates. Assumptions and further Simplifications to get desired Kretschmann scalar. Plot of the Kerr Black Hole in oblate spherodial coordinates using Wolfram Mathematica.
